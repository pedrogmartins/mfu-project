# MFU Project

Computational study regulating π-back-bonding strength of Cu site in MOF with a series of gas host molecules. Calculations include first-principles relaxations to identify local geometry and interaction energetics correlations, local orbital projections, bond vibrational stretch predictions and nudged elastic band simulations. Here you will find a sample of parsers to implement workflow tasks.
